# Shrimpbot Stable
*The original Shrimpbot*

Exactly what it says on the tin, the original Shrimpbot, which is based on discord.py. Has some limitations, but works well enough.

#How to Run
You must have discord.py *async*, not the modern day rewrite version.
To run, you need a python file named "ShrimpConfig" with a variable named "token" with the bot's token on it.
After that, running it should be pretty straight forward.
